# Emotion_Detection
This is the code repository for my master's thesis titled 'The Development of Deep Learning Methodology To Detect Emotions From Conversational Data'

### Running the program
Once you've cloned the repository, you must create a folder called 'Models', which is where the models will be stored once they have been created. 

You must also then download the GloVe 6Billion files and store them in the folder for GloVe. Depending on file management, you may need to change file paths.
